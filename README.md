# SkyChat
 SkyChat is a decentralized chat platform inspired by discord and slack.
 
# Inner Workings
 SkyChat is using skynet, ...
 
# How to use
 Because SkyChat uses skynet as its backend, and skynet has its own login solution (MySky) u will need to setup your MySky account.
 
 * MySky: https://skyprofile.hns.siasky.net/ (profile picture and username are required)
 
 Now when you open SkyChat you will be automatically loggen in.
 
 * SkyChat: https://skymessage-dac.hns.siasky.net/
 
# Important
 All data on SkyChat is public, meaning if a user is dedicated enough he can modifiy the client get access to all the data, but that shouldn't be a problem on already public server (note: message encryption is in works so private servers and dm's will be safe).
 
 At the moment Skynet is very slow, and the messages can take up to 20 seconds (averaging 8 seconds) to get fully sent. This will improve with developers optimizing Skynet.
