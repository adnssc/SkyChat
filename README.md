# SkyChat
 SkyChat is a decentralized chat platform inspired by discord and slack.
 
# Inner Workings
 SkyChat is using skynet, ...
 
# Important
 All data on SkyChat is public, meaning if a user is dedicated enough he can by modifiying the client get access to all the data, but that shouldn't be a problem on already public servers (note: message encryption is in works so private servers and dm's will be safe).
 
 At the moment Skynet is very slow, and the messages can take up to 20 seconds (averaging 8 seconds) to get fully sent. This will improve with developers optimizing Skynet.
